    <h1>You are my happiness</h1>
    <h2>Love paragraphs from the heart</h2>
    <h3>Your voice is my favorite sound</h3>
    <h4>You make my heart melt</h4>
    <h5>You make everything better. You are my everything</h5>
    <p>You are only one in my mind and in my heart. Do you know the effect you have on me? Even in times of stress, I find myself calmer than usual. I always seem to find the lighter side in things and situations. This is so unlike me, the pessimist I used to be. You are the only angel in my heart of heaven.</p>
    <p>I donâ€™t need the sun because you are the sun in my life, your shine brightens up my life, I am very sure of loving you forever.</p><br>
